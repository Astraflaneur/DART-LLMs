# Baselines for TT Decomposition Experiments

These are the baseline experiments for applying Tensor-Train (TT) decomposition to both Fully Connected Networks (FNNs) and ResNets on CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets. The experiments are conducted across three levels of optimization:
1. **Baseline GPU (PyTorch Implementation)**
2. **Custom CUDA Kernel Implementation**
3. **Triton Kernel + SafeTensors Optimization**

The following sections describe the experimental setup, metrics, results, and key observations.

## 2. Evaluation Metrics

The experiments are evaluated based on the following metrics:

- **Accuracy (%):** Classification accuracy on test sets.
- **Compression Ratio:** The ratio of parameters after TT decomposition relative to the original model (e.g., a compression ratio of 0.70 implies a 30% reduction in parameters).
- **Effective TT-Ranks:** Final effective ranks after adaptive pruning.
- **Memory Usage (MB):** Total memory footprint of the model.
- **Inference Latency (ms):** Time taken per inference pass.

## 4. Analysis & Discussion

### 4.1. Accuracy Impact
- **FNNs:**  
  - The TT-decomposed FNNs incur a minor accuracy drop (~1-2%) relative to the dense baseline.
  - Adaptive methods with custom CUDA kernels and Triton optimizations help recover or slightly improve performance.

- **ResNets:**  
  - Modified ResNets using TT layers maintain high accuracy (around 93% on CIFAR-10, 98.5% on MNIST) despite significant parameter reduction.

### 4.2. Compression & TT-Rank Reduction
- **FNNs:**  
  - Baseline GPU implementation reduces parameters by ~30%, while advanced optimizations (Triton + SafeTensors) achieve up to ~40% reduction.
  - Effective TT ranks are reduced from the initial [1, 4, 4, 1] to approximately [1, 3, 3, 1] in the optimized runs.

- **ResNets:**  
  - Similar compression trends are observed with ~30-40% reduction in model size.
  - The effective TT ranks in ResNet TT layers are consistent with FNN results.

### 4.3. Computational Overhead & Latency
- **Latency:**  
  - Custom CUDA kernels reduce latency by about 10–20% compared to the baseline PyTorch implementation.
  - Triton + SafeTensors further reduce latency by approximately 15–20%, making these models more suitable for edge deployment.

- **GFLOPs & Memory:**  
  - Optimized implementations show slight reductions in GFLOPs due to efficient TT contractions.
  - Memory usage is also reduced significantly when using SafeTensors.

---

## 5. Conclusion

The baseline experiments demonstrate that:
- TT decomposition applied to FNNs and ResNets can achieve significant compression (25–40% parameter reduction) with minimal accuracy loss.
- Optimizing TT operations with custom CUDA kernels and Triton + SafeTensors further reduces computational overhead and latency.
- The trade-offs between compression, effective TT ranks, and model performance are promising for future work on adaptive fine-tuning and deployment in resource-constrained environments.

## 6. Future Work
- **Adaptive Rank Selection:** Integrate dynamic, data-driven TT rank selection (using differentiable regularization and Gumbel-Softmax) into the baseline pipeline.
- **Extension to Other Architectures:** Apply the framework to Transformers, GNNs, and speech models.
- **Real-World Deployment:** Test on edge devices and multi-GPU systems to evaluate practical benefits.
